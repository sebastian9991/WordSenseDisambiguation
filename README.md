WSD algorithm (on inspo from Lesk's algorithm)

To understand this problem consider the sentence below: 

"The **bank** can guarantee deposits will eventually cover future tuition costs because it invests in adjustable-rate
mortgage securities" 

What is the meaning of the word bank? Consider we have instances from a polysemy set, bank.1 and bank.2. Bank.1 is "a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels...", bank.2 "sloping land...". We have two intentional definitions. To us, it is obvious which bank the sentence refers to. However, how can we algorithmically deduce that?
